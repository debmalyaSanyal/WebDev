<h1>ASSIGNMENT 02</h1>
<h2>Problem Statement :</h2> 
Bookmarking in HTML. Bookmarking refers to creating links to different parts of the same page. Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is too long to navigate content manually. To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it. When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
