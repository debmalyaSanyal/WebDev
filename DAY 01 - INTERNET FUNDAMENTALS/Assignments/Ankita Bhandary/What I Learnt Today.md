23 December,2022 is our first day of our WEB DEVELOPMENT bootcamp. Our mentor Mr. Abhishek kushawa told us about the Network system and show us the agenda of the day :-

DNS
ISP
DNS RESOLVER
HTTP AND HTTPS
CHECK IP FROM CMD
PORTS First, he started by telling about DNS, How we interact with ip by DNS and the PORTS and also about ISP,Computer Networks. From ISP, we get to know how we get the data from the server or host. From DNS, we know about the differences of EXTERNAL IPs and INTERNAL IPs. Then he tried to teach us how DNS resolver work. How it sort out small small problem by giving few examples. Then he helps us to know what is the differences between HTTP and HTTPS ? Many of them know the answer but not in appropriate words so, he clearified the about the HTTP and HTTPS. In this section we get to know about some new terms like GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and POST. He told us about some HTTP status code like 404 for NOT FOUND etc. Atlast he displayed us how we check IP from cmd. Thank You...(^ _ ^)
