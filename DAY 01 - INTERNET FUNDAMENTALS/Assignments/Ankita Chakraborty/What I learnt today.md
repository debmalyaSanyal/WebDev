- Extra---A demo‚≠ê


- ISP-Internet Service Provider is an organization which provides access to internet.
- DNS-To prevent hackers from hacking an organization's website a "Domain Name" is assigned to the websites.
- DNS Resolver-It is a service which connects a request and the required website which is being requested for by the user. It acts like a phone book by keeping track of    the sites visited by us.
- HTTP and HTTPS-These are the internet protocols which sends our requests in such a format that it can't be accessed by third parties and HTTPS sends our requests in an encrypted format thereby providing extra security.
- Ports-Ports are like gateways and each device and websites has unique port
- HTTP methods-There are HTTP methods such as-PUT,POST,GET,PATCH,DELETE.PUT,POST AND GET methods were primarily discussed during this session as they are the main three methods which are widely used.
- During this session we also got to know how can we know the port and IP addresses of our machine using cmd.
- Finally during the demo our speaker tried to demonstrate the above ideas using our GDSC JISU website.
